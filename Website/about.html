            <h2>About the Website Eye Robot</h2>
            <p>The Website Eye Robot is a cutting-edge project aimed at identifying and reporting design issues on
                responsive websites. Our solution involves building a system that scans a website at different
                resolutions,
                identifies design issues, and presents them to developers in a report. Our system includes complicated
                algorithms, image processing techniques and machine learning models
                to help identify different types of design issues automatically.</p>

            <h2>Why the Website Eye Robot is Important</h2>
            <p>The Website Eye Robot has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach responsive web design. By
                automating the process of identifying design issues, our system can help developers save time and
                improve
                the quality of their work. This, in turn, can lead to better user experiences and increased customer
                satisfaction. Additionally, our system can help businesses reduce the risk of costly design errors and
                improve their website's overall performance.</p>
